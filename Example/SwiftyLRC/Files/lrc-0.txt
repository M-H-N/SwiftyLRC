[00:01.63] I wanna be your slave, I wanna be your master
[00:04.27] I wanna make your heartbeat run like rollercoasters
[00:08.09] I wanna be a good boy, I wanna be a gangster
[00:11.71] 'Cause you could be the beauty and I could be the monster
[00:15.54] I love you since this morning, not just for aesthetic
[00:18.70] I wanna touch your body, so fucking electric
[00:22.78] I know you're scared of me, you say that I'm too eccentric
[00:26.26] I'm crying all my tears, and that's fucking pathetic
[00:29.98] I wanna make you hungry, then I wanna feed ya
[00:33.48] I wanna paint your face, like you're my Mona Lisa
[00:36.63] I wanna be a champion, I wanna be a loser
[00:40.91] I'll even bе a clown 'cause I just wanna amuse ya
[00:44.63] I wanna be your sеx toy, I wanna be your teacher
[00:48.10] I wanna be your sinner, wanna be a preacher
[00:51.62] I wanna make you love me, then I wanna leave ya
[00:55.33] 'Cause, baby, I'm your David, and you're my Goliath
[00:59.85] Uh-huh
[01:01.75] Hmm, uh-huh
[01:06.02] Because I'm the devil, who's searching for redemption
[01:09.56] And I'm a lawyer, who's searching for redemption
[01:13.28] And I'm a killer, who's searching for redemption
[01:16.77] I'm a motherfucking monster, who's searching for redemption
[01:20.59] And I'm a bad guy, who's searching for redemption
[01:23.78] And I'm a blonde girl, who's searching for redemption
[01:27.75] And I'm a freak that is searching for redemption
[01:31.28] I'm a motherfucking monster who's searching for redemption
[01:49.64] I wanna be your slave, I wanna be your master
[01:52.83] I wanna make your heartbeat run like rollercoasters
[01:56.33] I wanna be a good boy, I wanna be a gangster
[01:59.89] 'Cause you can be the beauty and I could be the monster
[02:03.87] I wanna make you quiet, I wanna make you nervous
[02:07.35] I wanna set you free, but I'm too fucking jealous
[02:10.27] I wanna pull your strings, like you're my telecaster
[02:14.26] And if you want to use me, I could be your puppet
[02:18.54] 'Cause I'm the devil, who's searching for redemption
[02:21.41] And I'm a lawyer, who's searching for redemption
[02:24.96] And I'm a killer, who's searching for redemption
[02:28.71] I'm a motherfucking monster who's searching for redemption
[02:32.97] I wanna be your slave, I wanna be your master
[02:34.03]
